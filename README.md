# ChAsE: Chromatin Analysis and Exploration Tool

ChAsE is a cross platform desktop application that provides an interactive graphical interface for analysis of epigenomic data. 

Features include:

* Exploration and visualization of the data using an interactive heat map and plot interface.
* Clustering the data automatically or manually by sorting and brushing the heat map.
* Set construction based on presence/absence of signal.
* Ability to compare different clusterings via set operations.
* Exporting results for downstream analysis or as high quality images for publications.

## Quick Start

### Installation
This software requires Java 7 or greater. It is recommended that you get the latest version of [Java SE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

* Download and extract the [latest binary distribution] (https://github.com/hyounesy/ChAsE/raw/master/dist/ChAsE_1.1.0.zip) if you don't want to build it yourself:

  * **Windows**: Double click ```Run_Windows.bat```.
  * **Mac**: Right click ```Run_OSX.command``` and select Open. Confirm running the application.
  * **Linux**: Double click ```Run_Unix.sh```.
  * Or, you may open a console and run the following in the command-line: ``` java -jar chase.jar ```
  
### Example Data
* [Example Workspace](https://github.com/hyounesy/ChAsE/raw/master/dist/ExampleWorkspace.zip): Contains two preprocessed exmaple workspaces which can be readily opened using the [Open Existing Analysis] Option 
* [Example Data](https://github.com/hyounesy/ChAsE/raw/master/dist/ExampleData.zip): Contains an example GFF file (mm9) and four WIG files which can be used to create a new workspace from scratch.
